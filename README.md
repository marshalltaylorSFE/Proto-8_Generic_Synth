#### Overview

Starting from a panel connected to the hardware, this repo shows the build up of software that results in a simple midi synth.  At start, the hardware passes the hardware test example but otherwise no software is written.
 
#### Milestones
 
Each milestone is listed here, and the repository is tagged at each milestone.

* [V_0.1](https://github.com/marshalltaylorSFE/Proto-8_Generic_Synth/tree/V_0.1) - Create hardware, test hardware, and create github associated with the project.
* [V_0.2](https://github.com/marshalltaylorSFE/Proto-8_Generic_Synth/tree/V_0.2) - Add time and resource scheduling.
* [V_0.3](https://github.com/marshalltaylorSFE/Proto-8_Generic_Synth/tree/V_0.3) - Connect hardware to software and give each panel component a type/function.* Create logic machine for panel components.
* Add Teensy audio platform with simple oscillator.
* Add MIDI reception, connect to oscillator.
